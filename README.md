# Speaker-Recognition
Comparison of various models used for speaker recognition

The following project is an investigation into the performance of some basic ML algorithms used to recognised a specific speaker among a set of voice clips.

Dataset:

 A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, A. Zisserman
VoxCeleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset  
INTERSPEECH, 2017

The project contains:

1) Python scripts:

Scripts for feature extraction and classification using SVM, GMM and a basic neural network

2) Matlab scripts:

Scripts for feature extraction and classification using SVM, GMM and a basic neural network

3) CSV files:

CSV files containing features extracted from specific files from the given dataset, namely MFCC

4) Papers refered to during literature survey

5) Final report summarising all efforts into the project
